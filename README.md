# Nostalgi2D
Nostalgi2D is a open source multiplatform 2D game engine built ontop of libgdx.
It relies on the TMX map format, so Tiled is recommended for designing your levels for games built with Nostalgi2D
Alot of the design choices for the framework has been inspired by Unreal Engine so if you have experimented with that engine before you might recoginize some of the concepts

## Your first project
It is recommended that you build your projects using Android studios as of this writing and it has only been tested on a PC.
When you start your first project you will find a couple of classes inside your core/src/com/nostalgi/game that is showing you some examples on how to wire things up

Currently there are a bunch of bundled free assets, these will be removed and changed into something else once the engine is in beta / release.
So please do not rely on these assets without giving credits to the designers in your live projects

## Roadmap
1 Animated tiles
2 SpawnerActor
3 Spatial sound sources
4 Level travelling
5 Basic AI Controller
6 Network / Multiplayer capabilities
