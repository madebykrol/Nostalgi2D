# Nostalgi2D
Nostalgi2D is a open source multiplatform 2D game engine built ontop of libgdx.
It relies on the TMX map format, so Tiled is recommended for designing your levels for games built with Nostalgi2D
Alot of the design choices for the framework has been inspired by Unreal Engine so if you have experimented with that engine before you might recoginize some of the concepts
